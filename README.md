# Introduction-To-Git_Assignment
This is the repo for assignment 15 of Junior Design. In it, we will alter the code from the previous Microcontroller assignment to gain experience with GitHub.

Assignment Tasks:
o One team member should create a repository that includes the source code to your Microcontroller "Hello World" Submission
o The other team members should copy or "Fork" the repo
o Each team member should create a new "Branch"
o Each team member should then edit the source code to include a comment that includes their name and should save, or, "commit" these changes
o The team members that "forked" the original repo should submit "pull requests" so as to initiate a requests for their changes to be accepted
o The original repository owner should accept and "merge" the committed changes
o The other team members should make their forked repos up to date by adding a remote "upstream" and merging that "upstream" with your fork.
