# Introduction-To-Git_Assignment

This is the repo for assignment 15 of Junior Design. In it, we will alter the code from the previous Microcontroller assignment to gain experience with GitHub.

## Assignment Tasks
- One team member should create a repository that includes the source code to your Microcontroller "Hello World" Submission.
- The other team members should copy or "Fork" the repo.
- Each team member should create a new "Branch".
- Each team member should then edit the source code to include a comment that includes their name and should save, or, "commit" these changes.
- The team members that "forked" the original repo should submit "pull requests" so as to initiate a request for their changes to be accepted.
- The original repository owner should accept and "merge" the committed changes.
- The other team members should make their forked repos up to date by adding a remote "upstream" and merging that "upstream" with your fork.
